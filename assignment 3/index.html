part-2 cool box

This HTML file contains a single <div> element with a class name, used to display a styled box on the page.
It doesn’t have a lot of content just the words “This is a cool box.”
The purpose is to link it to a CSS file and apply visual styles to the box.
It's meant to help practice working with box dimensions, colors, shadows, and layout.
